* This page
Previously, I generated a single page from an ~org-mode~ document using ~Emacs~. I appreciate the
simplicity of this approach. For a little more flexibility, I am now using [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][Hakyll]] to generate
everything from the Org source files. (/q.v./: [[./posts/2025-09-12-this_blog.html][Switching my website to Hakyll]])
