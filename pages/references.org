title: People referencing me
---

I discovered that there are quite a few references to my posts and thoughts on the Internet. It's quite a fun experience to read what people have to say second-hand, as opposed to reading comments on my Reddit posts or YouTube videos. I decided to collect a list of them here.

+ [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=11416][Irreal - Clocktables]]
  - Review of my Org mode clocktables video. Apparently sparked a post from [[reference][The Emacs Cat - Org Mode: Exporting Clock Tables]], which then got its own follow-up again from [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=11538][Irreal - Exporting Clock Tables]]. Fun to see how things can go round.
+ [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13257][Irreal - Emacs Bankruptcy]]
  - Irreal comments on the Reddit thread under my Emacs Bankruptcy video, which sparked a lively debate. He says that he doesn't understand my argument that Emacs Bankruptcy is natural when a configuration grows too large. Perhaps he misunderstood, or I was unclear. I don't believe it's a natural step for every long configuration, merely a good idea for long, /unruly/ configurations.
+ [[https://macadie.info/2023/12/16/2023-12-austin-emacs-meetup/][2023-12 Austin Emacs Meetup]]
  - Apparently there was some positive commentary on my EmacsConf 2023 Closing Remarks at the Austin Emacs Meetup from a professor in OKC.
+ [[https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/emacs-for-distraction-free-writing/][LucidManager - Emacs Org Mode for Distraction-Free Writing]]
  - Glad to see my Org Mode demo featured in this article.

+ [[https://lr0.fly.dev/yt.html][Hereby, all birds fly - YouTube Channels]]
  - Pleased to be on a list among the top names in the Emacs YouTube community.
+ [[https://yanboyang.com/posts/20230618184642-org_reveal][Boyang Yan - org-reveal]]
+ [[https://whhone.com/posts/emacs-in-a-terminal/][Wai Hon - Using Emacs in a Terminal]]
+ [[https://burntraisin.github.io/burntraisin-site/planners-and-productivity-apps-try-emacs/][burntraisin - Planners and Productivity Apps: Try Emacs]]
  - Nice to see myself on a personal blog that resonates with me.
