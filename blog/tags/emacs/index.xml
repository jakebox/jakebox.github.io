      <description>A habit I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up from my time writing journalism is using the letters TK to signify material that is not yet filled in. Many journalists use TK in place of underscores (_________), or a block of Xs (XXXXXXXXXX). TK, short for &amp;ldquo;to come,&amp;rdquo; is easy to search for, as few English words contain a T followed by a K, and stands out visually.
Regardless of its origin and utility, I use TKTKTKTK in my writing, much of which I do in Emacs&amp;rsquo; Org Mode.</description>

      <description>This is my first Straightforward Emacs blog post. Inspired by my video series, these posts will contain brief, descriptive write-ups of my favorite Emacs functions and features, problems I’ve solved, and short instructional guides. Many posts center on solving real world problems, especially with Org Mode, which I use to organize much of my work and personal life. I hope these posts will help you create and find solutions to your own problems.</description>
